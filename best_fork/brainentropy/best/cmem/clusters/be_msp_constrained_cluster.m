function clusters = be_msp_constrained_cluster(Seeds,CPM,VertConn,OPTIONS)
%
%
% BE_MSP_CONSTRAINED_CLUSTER creates clusters associated to each seeds, 
% while preventing vertices associated to two different components
% to be associated with the same cluster (cf CPM matrix: defines the 
% constraints for what components could be fused and should not be fused)
%
% INPUTS: 
%        -Seeds                 : the vector containing the indices of the centers of gravity of each cluster
%        -CPM                   : Complementarity Probability Map is a vector of size equal to the number of vertices of the Mesh. 
%                                 This map ensures that vertices assigned
%                                 to distinct signal components are not assigned to the same parcel.
%        -VertConn              : Neighborhood matrix. 
%        -OPTIONS 				: Structure of parameters (described in be_cmem_solver.m)
% OUTPUTS: 
%        -clusters              : Variable whose each cell k contains the indices of the vertices belonging to each cluster k
